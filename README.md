# Analyzing different parameters that lead to planet formation
- writing2.py is an updated code that calles all_planets2.py and runs it with the with_errors2.csv
- all_planets2.py uses PP.py (Joanna's pebble predictor) and OL18_new.py (Ormel and Liu's 2018 code) to run and test our models
- rough_work3.ipynb is used to test our new hypothesis on a specific planet from with_errors.csv 
- with_errors.csv is a list of all planets and their data from the caltech exoplanet repository. With_errors.csv was last downloaded freshly on June 19th, 2024

## How to work the code:
- Clone this repo and simply run writing.py. The rest should follow on its own.
- The code takes around 40-50 minutes to run
